AWS S3 Static Website Resume Project
AWS S3/CloudFront Static Website Resume Project

I have uploaded my resume onto AWS S3 and created a static website.
In order to complete this new project, I used an AWS S3 static bucket and enabled static hosting on the S3 Bucket.

I allowed public access to the S3 Bucket, so anyone can access the website.

Further to this, I created a policy on the S3 Bucket to allow Read-Only access to the public.

I uploaded my modified HTML files into the S3 Bucket and now anyone on the Internet can access that HTML page. I used Visual Studio Code to modify my HTML files.
